# Here is a possible code to find the fibonacci sequence in Julia:
# generated by https://www.bing.com => chat => generate Fibonacci sequence via Julia

# define a function to generate the fibonacci sequence
function fibonacci(n)
  # initialise the first two terms
  a::Int = 1
  b::Int = 1
  # create an empty array to store the sequence
  sequence = []
  # loop until n terms are generated
  for i in 1:n
    # append the current term to the sequence
    push!(sequence, a)
    # update the next term by adding the previous two terms
    c = a + b
    # update the previous two terms
    a = b
    b = c
  end
  # return the sequence as an array
  return sequence
end

# test the function with an example
n = 21
println("The first $n terms of the fibonacci sequence are:")
println(fibonacci(n))
