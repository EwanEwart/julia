    <!-- SVG Path - <path>

The <path> element is used to define a path.

The following commands are available for path data:

    M = moveto
    L = lineto
    H = horizontal lineto
    V = vertical lineto
    C = curveto
    S = smooth curveto
    Q = quadratic Bézier curve
    T = smooth quadratic Bézier curveto
    A = elliptical Arc
    Z = closepath

Note:
All of the commands above
can also be expressed with lower letters.
Capital letters means absolutely positioned,
lower cases means relatively positioned. -->

    <!-- The example below defines a path
that starts at position 150,0
with a line to position 75,200
then from there,
a line to 225,200
and finally closing the path back to 150,0: -->

    <path d="M150 0 L75 200 L225 200 Z" stroke="orangered" fill="#345776" />

<!-- Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely.
Generally, the user selects two endpoints and one or two control points.
A Bézier curve with one control point is called a quadratic Bézier curve
and the kind with two control points is called cubic.

The following example creates a quadratic Bézier curve.
A and C are the start and end points,
B is the control point: -->
