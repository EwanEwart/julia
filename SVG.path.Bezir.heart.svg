    SVG Path - <path>

    The <path> element is used to define a path.

    The following commands are available for path data:

        M = moveto
        L = lineto
        H = horizontal lineto
        V = vertical lineto
        C = curveto
        S = smooth curveto
        Q = quadratic Bézier curve
        T = smooth quadratic Bézier curve
        A = elliptical Arc
        Z = closepath

    Note:
    All of the commands above
    can also be expressed with lower letters.
    Capital letters means absolutely positioned,
    lower cases means relatively positioned. -->


    <!--

    Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely.
    Generally, the user selects two endpoints and one or two control points.
    A Bézier curve with one control point is called a quadratic Bézier curve
    and the kind with two control points is called cubic.
